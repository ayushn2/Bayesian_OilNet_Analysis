**Project Title:**
Bayesian Network Analysis of Dependencies Among Oil Companies

**Overview:**
This project, guided by Dr. Saptarshi Pyne, an Associate Professor at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Jodhpur in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, 
utilizes Bayesian networks to analyze and study the dependencies among major oil companies such as Chevron, ExxonMobil (XOM), and others. 
The primary goal is to uncover intricate relationships and dependencies within the oil sector, providing valuable insights into the interconnected nature of these companies.

**Objectives:**
**Analyze Dependencies:** Use Bayesian networks to model and analyze the dependencies among various oil companies.
**Data-Driven Insights:** Provide data-driven insights into how changes in one company can affect others within the network.
**Predictive Modeling:** Develop predictive models to forecast potential outcomes based on observed dependencies.
**Visualization:** Create visual representations of the dependencies to aid in understanding and decision-making.

**Methodology:**
Data Collection: Gather comprehensive data from various oil companies, including financial reports, market data, and other relevant metrics.
Bayesian Network Construction: Develop Bayesian networks to represent the dependencies and probabilistic relationships among the companies.
Dependency Analysis: Use the constructed networks to analyze and interpret the dependencies, identifying key influencers and dependent entities.
Validation: Validate the models using historical data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Visualization Tools: Implement visualization tools to represent the network and its dependencies in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.

**Future Directions:**
Extension to SaaS: Extend the project into a Software as a Service (SaaS) web application, making it accessible to a broader audience.
Real-Time Analysis: Incorporate real-time data feeds to provide up-to-date analysis and insights.
User Interface: Develop an intuitive user interface to allow users to interact with the network, run simulations, and generate custom reports.
Scalability: Ensure the application can scale to handle a large number of users and extensive datasets.
Integration: Integrate with other data sources and tools to enhance the functionality and usability of the application.

**Potential Impact:**
Strategic Decision-Making: Assist oil companies and investors in making informed strategic decisions based on the identified dependencies and predictive insights.
Risk Management: Aid in risk management by understanding how fluctuations in one company can impact others.
Market Analysis: Provide a comprehensive tool for market analysts to study the oil sector's dynamics.

**Conclusion:**
This project represents a significant advancement in understanding the complexities and dependencies within the oil industry. 
By leveraging Bayesian networks and extending the project into a SaaS application, we aim to provide a powerful tool for industry stakeholders, enhancing their ability to make data-driven decisions and effectively manage risks.
